# Cosmic Foundry — Architecture

## Commitments

These are the foundational claims about this repository. Each is a
commitment: the code must satisfy it, tests enforce it where possible,
and any PR that violates a claim must explicitly revise it here rather
than quietly breaking it.

**Cosmic Foundry is a general-purpose PDE simulation engine, optimized
for astrophysical use cases.**

**The mathematical language of the architecture is differential geometry
on spatio-temporal manifolds, with PDE theory as the application layer.**

**Physical quantities are represented as instances of formal mathematical
abstractions.**

**Every numerical method is formally derived from its continuous
mathematical counterpart, and machine-checkable, where possible.**

**Every object that claims to represent a specific physical scenario is paired
with a testable claim about that scenario — symbolic or numerical — that CI can
check. For numerical methods this claim is verification against an analytical
solution, with the test living in this repository.**

**Where external data sources are ingested the uncertainty in that
data is explicitly quantified and propagated.**

**The engine is dimensionless internally.**

## Layer architecture

The codebase is organized into five packages with a strict dependency order:

```
theory/
  foundation/ ←── continuous/ ←── discrete/
                                        ↑         ↑
                                   geometry/   computation/
                                        ↑         ↑
                                        └─physics/─┘
```

`A ←── B` means B imports from A (B sits above A in the stack).
`computation/` has no imports from `theory/` or `geometry/`; the two
paths into `physics/` are independent.

`foundation/`, `continuous/`, and `discrete/` are nested under `theory/`,
making the symbolic-reasoning boundary a directory boundary.

**`theory/` and `geometry/` are the symbolic-reasoning layer.**
`foundation/`, `continuous/`, `discrete/`, and `geometry/` all share the same
identity: they describe mathematical structure symbolically, without numerical
evaluation. `geometry/` is coordinate geometry infrastructure — manifolds,
charts, and meshes defined by SymPy expressions; numerical array allocation
belongs in `computation/`. Their import boundary reflects that shared identity —
they may only import from the Python standard library, `cosmic_foundry`, or
packages on the approved symbolic-reasoning list. The approved list is
`{sympy}`. Additions require justification against the symbolic-reasoning
identity; numerical computation packages (JAX, NumPy, SciPy) are excluded by
definition. Enforced by `tests/test_theory_no_third_party_imports.py`.

**`physics/` is the application/concreteness layer.** It implements specific
physical models (PDE operators, discretization schemes). `physics/` may import
from all other packages.

**`computation/` is the numeric machinery layer.** It must not import from
`theory/` or `geometry/` or `physics/`; enforced by
`scripts/ci/check_computation_imports.py`. All numeric library imports
(`math`, `numpy`, `jax`, etc.) are confined here; enforced by
`scripts/ci/check_numeric_imports.py`.

                                Discretization: DiscreteField → DiscreteField
                                NumericalFlux:  DiscreteField → FaceField
                              Earns its class via two falsifiable claims:
                                order: int — composite convergence order
                                continuous_operator: DifferentialOperator —
                                  the continuous operator this approximates
                                  (threaded automatically by Discretization
                                  from its input L)
                              Not independently constructed from stencil
                              coefficients; produced by a Discretization.

NumericalFlux(DiscreteOperator[DiscreteField, FaceField])
                            — cell-average → face-flux operator:
                                __call__(U: DiscreteField) → FaceField
                              where U holds cell-average values.  The
                              returned FaceField is indexed as
                              result((axis, idx_low)) and returns the flux
                              F·n̂·|face_area| at that face.  Inherits order
                              and continuous_operator from DiscreteOperator.

DiscreteExteriorDerivative(ABC)
                            — NOT a DiscreteOperator; exact chain map, no truncation
                              error. Interface: mesh: Mesh, degree: int,
                              __call__(field: DiscreteField) → DiscreteField.
                              d∘d = 0 exactly (algebraic identity).
                              Does not carry order or continuous_operator because
                              it is not an approximation — it is exact by construction.

### computation/

The only layer that may import numeric libraries (`math`, `numpy`, `jax`,
etc.); all other layers are restricted to the Python standard library and
approved symbolic packages. Enforced by `scripts/ci/check_numeric_imports.py`.
Must not import from `theory/`, `geometry/`, or `physics/`; enforced by
`scripts/ci/check_computation_imports.py`.

```
Real(Protocol)      — scalar numeric protocol; satisfied by float, int,
                      numpy.float16/32/64, JAX scalars. Covers exactly the
                      arithmetic operations Tensor applies to its elements.

Tensor              — arbitrary-rank numeric array backed by a pluggable
                      Backend. Single public API over multiple storage
                      strategies. Supports construction, indexing,
                      arithmetic (+, −, *, /), einsum, matmul, norm, diag,
                      SVD, copy, to_list, and to(backend). Rank-0 through
                      rank-n; all shapes uniform (no jagged arrays).

Backend(Protocol)   — per-instance dispatch strategy. Mixed-backend
                      arithmetic raises ValueError. Backends:

    PythonBackend   — nested Python lists; reference implementation;
                      no external dependencies. Leaf values are unconstrained
                      Python objects, so sympy.Expr leaves work transparently
                      (used by the symbolic order-proof path in physics/).
    NumpyBackend(dtype=None)
                    — NumPy ndarray; dtype inferred from input by default
                      or fixed to an explicit numpy dtype; vectorized via
                      BLAS/LAPACK.
    JaxBackend      — JAX array; immutable functional updates routed through
                      `Tensor.__setitem__` via `slice_set`. Caller is responsible
                      for `@jax.jit` placement at solver / time-step granularity.

LinearSolver        — mesh-agnostic interface: solve(a: Tensor, b: Tensor) → Tensor.
                      Accepts an assembled N×N stiffness matrix and an N-vector
                      RHS; returns the solution vector. Assembly and index mapping
                      are the caller's responsibility, keeping computation/ free
                      of theory/discrete/ and physics/ dependencies.
                      SCOPE: linear operators only. Epoch 6 hydro (nonlinear
                      flux) requires a separate NonlinearSolver / Newton
                      iteration. LinearSolver is not the shared machinery
                      for Epoch 6; only DivergenceFormDiscretization and NumericalFlux
                      are reused across epochs.
                      Ships DenseJacobiSolver (weighted Jacobi, ω derived
                      from Gershgorin bound; works for both order=2 and
                      order=4 stencils) and DenseLUSolver (direct, in-place
                      LU with partial pivoting). Both operate on Tensor;
                      linear algebra hand-rolled, no LAPACK. Convergence
                      tests cap at N ≤ 32 in 2-D (≤ 1024 unknowns).
```

**Time-integration layer** (`computation/time_integrators/`).  A typed,
modular layer supporting explicit RK, implicit DIRK, IMEX, exponential,
multistep (Adams / BDF), variable-order, symplectic, and operator-splitting
families through a common six-axis DSL (RHS protocol, state, step program,
coefficient algebra, controller, verification primitives).

### Cross-cutting

**Kernel composition model.**
Realized as the `Backend` protocol in `computation/backends/`. `Tensor`
is the single public interface; `Backend` is the strategy that governs
storage and execution. Backends are per-instance; dispatch is
identity-checked (`is`), not type-checked, so user-defined backends
satisfying the protocol are first-class. Open questions: `@jax.jit`
tracing policy for `JaxBackend` (per-call JIT vs. solver-level JIT);
whether `set_default_backend` is sufficient for solver-level selection
or a solver-level override is needed.

## Current work: Epoch 4 — Time integration layer

### Unification roadmap

The current layer works but contains two forms of fragmentation that
compound as the integrator family grows.  The roadmap below resolves
both, producing a single coherent entry point whose algorithm selection
is driven entirely by the mathematical structure of the problem.

#### Vocabulary — mathematically named replacements

The table below replaces every name rooted in a specific algorithm or
implementer convention with a name that describes mathematical function.
The right column is the target name; the left column is the current
name.  The migration is breaking; it happens in phases (see below).

| Current name | Target name | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `RKState` | `ODEState` *(done)* | A Runge-Kutta state is just an ODE integration state: (t, u, dt, err). `MultistepState` folded in via `history` field. |
| `NordsieckState` | `MultistepState` | The Nordsieck encoding is an implementation detail; the concept is a multistep history of past solution data. |
| `PartitionedState` | *(eliminated — done)* | Folded into `ODEState.u = concat([q, p])`; `SymplecticCompositionIntegrator` unpacks via `HamiltonianSplit.split_index`. |
| `DIRKIntegrator` | `ImplicitRungeKuttaIntegrator` | DIRK is one implementation strategy for implicit RK; the public name should say "implicit Runge-Kutta". |
| `IMEXIntegrator` | `AdditiveRungeKuttaIntegrator` | IMEX is the physics abbreviation; the mathematical name is additive Runge-Kutta (ARK). |
| `NordsieckIntegrator` | `MultistepIntegrator` | Same reasoning as `NordsieckState`. |
| `StrangSplittingIntegrator` | `CompositionIntegrator` | Strang is one composition scheme; the class is the general composition meta-integrator. |
| `SymplecticSplittingIntegrator` | `SymplecticCompositionIntegrator` *(done)* | Specializes `CompositionIntegrator` with symplecticity constraint. |
| `LinearPlusNonlinearRHS` | `SemilinearRHS` | du/dt = Lu + N(t,u) is a semilinear ODE; the name should say so. |
| `AdditiveRHS` | `SplitRHS` | Carries an explicit/implicit split; "additive" is the ARK term, "split" is the mathematical concept. |
| `HamiltonianSplit` | `HamiltonianRHS` | The protocol describes a Hamiltonian RHS; "split" implies an algorithmic choice. |
| `OperatorSplitRHS` | `CompositeRHS` | Carries k component RHS objects; "composite" names the mathematical structure. |

#### Axis A — unified dispatch surface

**Goal.** A single `Integrator.step(rhs, state, dt)` entry point that
selects the algorithm family by inspecting `rhs` against the protocol
hierarchy.  No caller changes the integrator when they change the RHS;
the dispatch is transparent.

**Design.**

```
Integrator (ABC / Protocol)
  step(rhs: RHSProtocol, state: ODEState, dt: float) -> ODEState
```

The concrete `AutoIntegrator` implements `step` as a dispatch chain:

```python
if isinstance(rhs, SemilinearRHS):
    # exponential integrator family
elif isinstance(rhs, HamiltonianRHS):
    # symplectic composition family
elif isinstance(rhs, CompositeRHS):
    # general composition family
elif isinstance(rhs, SplitRHS):
    # additive RK (ARK) family
elif isinstance(rhs, ImplicitRHS):   # WithJacobianRHSProtocol
    # implicit RK family
else:
    # explicit RK family (default)
```

The dispatch chain is a total function: every `RHSProtocol` falls into
exactly one branch.  Adding a new RHS type adds a new branch; existing
callers are unaffected.

**Existing specialist integrators** (`RungeKuttaIntegrator`,
`ImplicitRungeKuttaIntegrator`, …) remain as first-class objects.
`AutoIntegrator` is a convenience wrapper, not a replacement; users who
know their algorithm keep using the specific class.

**Type coherence requirement.** All specialist integrators must satisfy
the `Integrator` protocol — concretely, `DIRKIntegrator` and
`IMEXIntegrator` must inherit (or structurally match) the same
`TimeIntegrator` ABC that `RungeKuttaIntegrator` currently inherits.
This is the most impactful single cleanup and unblocks Axis A.

---

#### Axis B — unified state type

**Goal.** Replace four incompatible state types with one.  The
`ODEState` type carries optional slots for structure that only some
methods use; methods that do not need a slot ignore it.

**Target definition.**

```
ODEState:
    t:    float          — current time
    u:    Tensor         — current solution vector (or structured pair for Hamiltonian)
    dt:   float          — last accepted step size
    err:  float          — last local error estimate (0.0 if not available)
    history: MultistepHistory | None
               — ordered ring buffer of past (t_k, u_k, f_k) tuples;
                 None for single-step methods
```

**Migration path per affected type.**

- `MultistepState` *(done)* — `ExplicitMultistepIntegrator` now stores past
  `f` evaluations in `ODEState.history` as `tuple[Tensor, ...]` (most-recent
  first).  `None` means no history (initial step); the integrator bootstraps
  with `rk4` until enough history is available.

- `NordsieckState` — replace with `ODEState` carrying
  `history = NordsieckHistory(nordsieck_vector)`.  `NordsieckHistory` holds
  the scaled-derivative vector and exposes `change_order()` / `rescale_step()`
  (methods currently on `NordsieckState`).  `NordsieckIntegrator` reads/writes
  `history`; single-step integrators pass through `state.history = None`.

**Breaking change surface.** `TimeStepper.advance` return type changed
from `RKState` to `ODEState` in D1; field names are identical (`t`, `u`, `dt`,
`err`), so destructuring callsites are unaffected.

---

#### Phased implementation plan

Each phase is a self-contained PR that leaves all tests green and adds
at least one new test for the structural change.

| Phase | Title | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Unified state (done)** | Rename `RKState → ODEState`; fold `MultistepState` into `ODEState.history`; `TimeStepper.advance` returns `ODEState`. |
| D2 | **Fold NordsieckState** | Introduce `NordsieckHistory` wrapper; `ODEState.history = NordsieckHistory(...)` replaces `NordsieckState`; move `change_order()` / `rescale_step()` to `NordsieckHistory`. |
| E | **Rename sweep** | All target names from the vocabulary table replace current names; deprecation warnings on old names for one release cycle; B-series verification re-exports under new names. |
| F | **`AutoIntegrator`** | Implement dispatch chain; add integration test that passes each RHS type through `AutoIntegrator` and verifies correct order. |

Phase D2 can proceed immediately.  Phases E and F require D2.

**Open questions:**

1. **`set_default_backend` vs. solver-level override.** Time-integrator
   code must inherit whichever resolution lands; a per-`TimeStepper`
   backend override is the natural API extension if process-wide defaults
   turn out to be insufficient.

**Design decisions to revisit in later epochs:**

- AMR (Epoch 12): time-stepper must accept hierarchical state once meshes
  refine; integrator state types may need a coarse-fine variant.
- GR (Epoch 13): integrator state and step program become coupled to a
  dynamical 3-metric; the structured-RHS protocol may need a
  `WithMetricRHS` variant.
- Temporal convergence verification across spatial dimensions: spatial
  framework now covers 1D / 2D / 3D; temporal claims should likewise
  verify across problem dimensions where applicable.

---

## Cross-cutting open questions

Items that are not scoped to any specific epoch.  They surface here so they
are not lost; the decision of when and how to schedule them is made when
the implementation lane becomes clear.

**HDF5 checkpoint/restart.** Persistent serialization of simulation state
(time-stepper state, mesh fields, parameters) with provenance sidecars
(git hash, timestamp, parameter record).  GPU-written checkpoints must be
readable on CPU-only machines.  Not assigned to an epoch; the right time
to schedule depends on which integrator state types end up carrying
non-serializable data and on whether checkpointing arrives as part of a
broader persistence layer or as a standalone capability.

### Per-epoch verification standard

Every epoch must satisfy this checklist before it is considered verified:

- Derivation document with SymPy checks for any new numerical scheme (Lanes B and C)
- At least one externally-grounded convergence test against an analytical solution
  or observational data (not an engine-generated golden file); where an analytical
  solution exists, the relevant `NumericFunction.symbolic` is declared so the
  check runs automatically
- Lane A/B/C classification stated in the PR description
