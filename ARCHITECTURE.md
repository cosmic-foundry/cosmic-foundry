# Cosmic Foundry — Architecture

## Commitments

These are the foundational claims about this repository. Each is a
commitment: the code must satisfy it, tests enforce it where possible,
and any PR that violates a claim must explicitly revise it here rather
than quietly breaking it.

**Cosmic Foundry is a general-purpose PDE simulation engine, optimized
for astrophysical use cases.**

**The mathematical language of the architecture is differential geometry
on spatio-temporal manifolds, with PDE theory as the application layer.**

**Physical quantities are represented as instances of formal mathematical
abstractions.**

**Every numerical method is formally derived from its continuous
mathematical counterpart, and machine-checkable, where possible.**

**Every object that claims to represent a specific physical scenario is paired
with a testable claim about that scenario — symbolic or numerical — that CI can
check. For numerical methods this claim is verification against an analytical
solution, with the test living in this repository.**

**Where external data sources are ingested the uncertainty in that
data is explicitly quantified and propagated.**

**The engine is dimensionless internally.**

## Layer architecture

The codebase is organized into five packages with a strict dependency order:

```
theory/
  foundation/ ←── continuous/ ←── discrete/
                                        ↑         ↑
                                   geometry/   computation/
                                        ↑         ↑
                                        └─physics/─┘
```

`A ←── B` means B imports from A (B sits above A in the stack).
`computation/` has no imports from `theory/` or `geometry/`; the two
paths into `physics/` are independent.

`foundation/`, `continuous/`, and `discrete/` are nested under `theory/`,
making the symbolic-reasoning boundary a directory boundary.

**`theory/` and `geometry/` are the symbolic-reasoning layer.**
`foundation/`, `continuous/`, `discrete/`, and `geometry/` all share the same
identity: they describe mathematical structure symbolically, without numerical
evaluation. `geometry/` is coordinate geometry infrastructure — manifolds,
charts, and meshes defined by SymPy expressions; numerical array allocation
belongs in `computation/`. Their import boundary reflects that shared identity —
they may only import from the Python standard library, `cosmic_foundry`, or
packages on the approved symbolic-reasoning list. The approved list is
`{sympy}`. Additions require justification against the symbolic-reasoning
identity; numerical computation packages (JAX, NumPy, SciPy) are excluded by
definition. Enforced by `tests/test_theory_no_third_party_imports.py`.

**`physics/` is the application/concreteness layer.** It implements specific
physical models (PDE operators, discretization schemes). `physics/` may import
from all other packages.

**`computation/` is the numeric machinery layer.** It must not import from
`theory/` or `geometry/` or `physics/`; enforced by
`scripts/ci/check_computation_imports.py`. All numeric library imports
(`math`, `numpy`, `jax`, etc.) are confined here; enforced by
`scripts/ci/check_numeric_imports.py`.

                              Earns its class via two falsifiable claims:

NumericalFlux(DiscreteOperator[DiscreteField, FaceField])

                              where U holds cell-average values.  The
                              returned FaceField is indexed as
                              result((axis, idx_low)) and returns the flux
                              F·n̂·|face_area| at that face.  Inherits order
                              and continuous_operator from DiscreteOperator.

DiscreteExteriorDerivative(ABC)
                            — NOT a DiscreteOperator; exact chain map, no truncation
                              error. Interface: mesh: Mesh, degree: int,

                              Does not carry order or continuous_operator because
                              it is not an approximation — it is exact by construction.

Real(Protocol)      — scalar numeric protocol; satisfied by float, int,
                      numpy.float16/32/64, JAX scalars. Covers exactly the
                      arithmetic operations Tensor applies to its elements.

Tensor              — arbitrary-rank numeric array backed by a pluggable
                      Backend. Single public API over multiple storage
                      strategies. Supports construction, indexing,
                      arithmetic (+, −, *, /), einsum, matmul, norm, diag,
                      SVD, copy, to_list, and to(backend). Rank-0 through
                      rank-n; all shapes uniform (no jagged arrays).

Backend(Protocol)   — per-instance dispatch strategy. Mixed-backend
                      arithmetic raises ValueError. Backends:

    PythonBackend   — nested Python lists; reference implementation;
                      no external dependencies. Leaf values are unconstrained
                      Python objects, so sympy.Expr leaves work transparently
                      (used by the symbolic order-proof path in physics/).
    NumpyBackend(dtype=None)
                    — NumPy ndarray; dtype inferred from input by default
                      or fixed to an explicit numpy dtype; vectorized via
                      BLAS/LAPACK.
    JaxBackend      — JAX array; immutable functional updates routed through
                      `Tensor.__setitem__` via `slice_set`. Caller is responsible
                      for `@jax.jit` placement at solver / time-step granularity.

LinearSolver        — mesh-agnostic interface: solve(a: Tensor, b: Tensor) → Tensor.
                      Accepts an assembled N×N stiffness matrix and an N-vector
                      RHS; returns the solution vector. Assembly and index mapping
                      are the caller's responsibility, keeping computation/ free
                      of theory/discrete/ and physics/ dependencies.
                      SCOPE: linear operators only. Epoch 6 hydro (nonlinear
                      flux) requires a separate NonlinearSolver / Newton
                      iteration. LinearSolver is not the shared machinery
                      for Epoch 6; only DivergenceFormDiscretization and NumericalFlux
                      are reused across epochs.
                      Ships DenseJacobiSolver (weighted Jacobi, ω derived
                      from Gershgorin bound; works for both order=2 and
                      order=4 stencils) and DenseLUSolver (direct, in-place
                      LU with partial pivoting). Both operate on Tensor;
                      linear algebra hand-rolled, no LAPACK. Convergence
                      tests cap at N ≤ 32 in 2-D (≤ 1024 unknowns).
```

**Planned additions (Epoch 4):** time-integration layer — `TimeIntegrator`
ABC, `RungeKuttaIntegrator`, `TimeStepper`, `Autotuner` extension; structured
RHS protocols (`HamiltonianSplit`, `WithJacobian`, `Additive`,
`LinearPlusNonlinear`, `OperatorSplit`) and additional integrator families
introduced phase-by-phase per the [Epoch 4
sprint](#current-work-epoch-4--time-integration-layer).

### Cross-cutting

**Kernel composition model.**
Realized as the `Backend` protocol in `computation/backends/`. `Tensor`
is the single public interface; `Backend` is the strategy that governs
storage and execution. Backends are per-instance; dispatch is
identity-checked (`is`), not type-checked, so user-defined backends
satisfying the protocol are first-class. Open questions: `@jax.jit`
tracing policy for `JaxBackend` (per-call JIT vs. solver-level JIT);
whether `set_default_backend` is sufficient for solver-level selection
or a solver-level override is needed.

## Current work: Epoch 4 — Time integration layer

**Target.** A typed, modular time-integration layer that scales from explicit
Runge-Kutta to implicit, exponential, multistep, variable-order, splitting,
and symplectic methods without interface redesign.  The interface is shaped
by a six-axis DSL — RHS protocol, state representation, step program,
coefficient algebra, controller, verification primitives — and the roadmap
relaxes each axis from its degenerate value through nine phases tied to
physics-epoch needs.

The DSL framing rests on the observation that "basic arithmetic + black-box
RHS" is provably the Butcher group (B-series): every richer family —
exponential, IMEX, Rosenbrock, multistep, variable-order, symplectic —
relaxes a specific structural constraint.  Each phase below relaxes exactly
one or two of those constraints with concrete physics motivation, so the
DSL is earned axis-by-axis rather than designed up-front.  The typed slot
shape (`RHSProtocol`, integrator-specific `State`, `Controller`) is
established in `computation/time_integrators/`; subsequent phases extend
without breaking interfaces.

**Phase 2 — B-series order verification framework.** `RootedTree`
enumeration through user-specified order; symbolic `γ(τ)` (tree integral)
and `σ(τ)` (symmetry factor); `α(τ)` extraction from any RK program via the
recursion `α(τ) = bᵀ Φ(τ)`.  Replaces the per-instance hardcoded order
check with the universal "for all `τ` with `|τ| ≤ p`, `α(τ) = 1/γ(τ)`."
Activates the verification axis.  Foundation for every subsequent phase's
order proof.

**Phase 3 — Symplectic / Hamiltonian splitting.** `HamiltonianSplit(T_of_p,
V_of_q)` RHS protocol; `PartitionedState(t, q, p)` state;
`SymplecticSplittingIntegrator(c, d)` parameterized by composition
coefficients; named instances: symplectic Euler, Verlet/leapfrog,
Forest-Ruth, Yoshida-6, Yoshida-8.  Verification framework extends to
P-series (partitioned trees with two colors); symplecticity check via
canonical 2-form preservation; modified-Hamiltonian conservation over long
integrations.  First non-RK family.  Epoch 8 self-gravity / particle
enabler.

**Phase 4 — Implicit RK (DIRK / SDIRK).** `WithJacobianRHS(f, J)` protocol
(`J` analytical or finite-difference); stage-solver injection through the
existing `IterativeSolver` infrastructure; `WithFactoredOperatorState`
caching `(I − γhJ)` factorizations across stages; named instances: backward
Euler, implicit midpoint, SDIRK4, ESDIRK methods.  Verification: B-series
unchanged (DIRK is RK with non-strictly-lower-triangular `A`); symbolic
extraction of stability function `R(z)`; A-stability and L-stability
claims; convergence on Van der Pol / Robertson / HIRES.  First phase that
relaxes "finite arithmetic."  Epoch 9 microphysics enabler.

**Phase 5 — IMEX additive RK.** `AdditiveRHS(f_E, f_I)` protocol;
`IMEXIntegrator(A_E, b_E, c_E, A_I, b_I, c_I, order)` consuming both
tableaux and reusing the Phase 4 stage-solver for the implicit pieces;
named instances: ARS222, ARS443, ARK4(3)6L (Kennedy-Carpenter).
Verification: combined-method order conditions; convergence on advection-
diffusion with stiff diffusion + nonstiff advection.  Epoch 10 MHD
enabler.

**Phase 6 — Explicit Adams-Bashforth.** `WithFHistoryState(t, y, [f_{n−1},
…, f_{n−k+1}])`; `LinearMultistepIntegrator(ρ, σ)` parameterized by
characteristic polynomials; RK4 bootstrap for the first `k − 1` steps;
named instances: AB2, AB3, AB4.  Verification: LMM order conditions slot
into the Phase 2 framework as a sibling tree calculus (NB-series).  First
phase with non-trivial typed state.  Mostly groundwork for Phase 7.

**Phase 7 — BDF + VODE-style variable-order controller.** `NordsieckState`
representation; `BDFFamily(q_max=6)` and `AdamsFamily(q_max=12)` as
parametric families producing tableaux for any order `q`; `OrderSelector`
choosing `q_next ∈ {q − 1, q, q + 1}` from cross-order error estimates;
`StiffnessSwitcher` flipping Adams ↔ BDF based on a streaming spectral-
radius estimate; `VODEController` composing all three.  Verification: order
verification across `q ∈ {1, …, q_max}` for both families; family-switch
correctness on a stiffness-step problem.  Activates the "method family +
policy" axis — the integrator's identity becomes a function of run-time
diagnostics, not a fixed tableau.

**Phase 8 — Exponential integrators.** `LinearPlusNonlinearRHS(L, N)`
protocol; φ-function evaluation (scaling-and-squaring on dense `hL` for
small problems, Krylov / Arnoldi projection for large problems);
`PhiFunction(k)` coefficient algebra (operator-valued tableau entries);
named instances: ETD-Euler, ETDRK2, ETDRK4 (Cox-Matthews), Krogstad's
method.  Verification: stiff-order conditions (Hochbruck-Ostermann) on
`a_ij(z), b_j(z)` as functions of `z`; convergence on Allen-Cahn /
Gray-Scott / 2D Burgers.  Activates the coefficient-algebra axis.
Epoch 11 radiation enabler.

**Phase 9 — Operator splitting (Strang / Lie).** `OperatorSplitRHS([f_1, …,
f_k])` protocol; `StrangSplittingIntegrator(sub_integrators, sequence)` as
a meta-integrator delegating each substep to a peer `TimeIntegrator`.
Verification: combined order from commutator analysis (Lie 1st order;
Strang 2nd order; Yoshida-style triple-jump for higher even orders).
Activates compositionality of the integrator stack itself.  Epoch 10 MHD /
multi-physics enabler.

**Cross-phase deliverable: integrator benchmark library.** A growing
problem catalog and harness against which integrators are graded on
correctness, work-per-accuracy, scaling with state dimension, and
conservation-law fidelity.  Structured into three tiers that activate
as the corresponding integrator families come online; the harness
skeleton and Tier A ship alongside Phase 0 so that subsequent phases
each land with a benchmarkable deliverable.  Everything in the library
is Lane C: every problem RHS is coded from first-principles ODE
definitions, every rate coefficient is generated procedurally, and
every reference solution is computed inline by our own integrators
at tightened tolerance.  No external code is ported, no
rate-coefficient or trajectory tables are loaded from disk, and no
external integrator is invoked at any point.

*Tier A — Non-stiff (with Phase 0–1).* Scalar linear `dy/dt = λy`
(promoted from the temporal-convergence claim); logistic;
two-species predator-prey (conserved quantity, no closed form);
three-compartment SIR; two-body gravitational (analytical orbit with
energy and angular-momentum invariants); three-equation chaotic
system (integrator-sensitivity probe); two-species reaction-diffusion
oscillator.

*Tier B — Stiff baselines (with Phase 4).* Parametric synthetic
problems exercising the stiffness regimes that real applications
present:

- Stiff scalar with forcing, `dy/dt = -k · y + s(t)`, with
  `k ∈ {10, 10², 10⁴, 10⁶}` — stability-detection probe.
- Three-species mass-conserving stiff chemistry archetype, with
  parameterized rate disparity (up to ~10⁹ between fast and slow
  timescales).
- Synthetic small-and-medium stiff networks of `n ∈ {8, 20}` species,
  produced by the Tier C generator at small sizes and tuned for
  stiffness contrast rather than nuclear-network resemblance.
- Stiff nonlinear oscillator `du/dt = v, dv/dt = -ω² u − α(u² − 1) v`
  with `α ∈ {1, 10², 10³, 10⁵}` as a fixed-problem stiffness sweep.

*Tier C — Network-scale, nuclear-resembling (with Phase 7).* The
user-facing payload.  Synthetic networks designed to numerically
resemble thermonuclear reaction networks: dozens to hundreds of
species, rate coefficients spanning ~10 orders of magnitude, sparse
Jacobian, exact mass conservation, positivity of every species.
Concrete problems:

- **Synthetic alpha-chain networks**, parameterized by chain length
  `n ∈ {13, 19, 21, 51, 101, 201, 501}`.  Linear capture-chain
  topology emulating alpha-rich nuclear burning; rate coefficients
  drawn from a log-normal distribution to span ~10 decades.  Exact
  invariants by construction: `Σ X_i = 1` (mass conservation) and
  `X_i ≥ 0` (positivity).
- **Synthetic CNO-cycle networks**, `n ∈ {6, 12, 24}`.  Cyclic
  topology with parameterized breakout-branch ratios; tunable
  stiffness contrast.
- **Synthetic rp-process networks**, `n ∈ {30, 60, 120}`.  Branched
  topology emulating proton-rich freezeout structure with multiple
  competing timescales.

*Synthetic network generator.* Small DSL for declaring
reaction-network topologies (alpha-chain, cycle, branched, random
sparse), parameterized by species count and rate-coefficient
distribution.  Produces a `WithJacobianRHS` instance with sparse
(CSR) Jacobian and a linear conservation matrix `C` such that
`C · Y = 0` is an exact algebraic identity.  Random-rate draws are
seeded so problem definitions are reproducible across runs.

*Metrics.* Per `(integrator, problem)` cell: final-time L² and L∞
error vs reference; RHS and Jacobian evaluation counts; wall time;
accepted and rejected step counts; conservation drift
`‖C · Y(t_end)‖`; minimum `X_i` over the trajectory (positivity);
for Tier C, runtime scaling exponent in `n`.

*Harness.* Lives in `tests/benchmarks/`, separate from the
correctness claims in `tests/test_time_integrators.py`.  Auto-discovers
`BenchmarkProblem` instances and runs each `TimeIntegrator` from the
`_INSTANCES` registry in `tests/test_time_integrators.py` against every
compatible problem (compatibility = problem's `RHSProtocol` satisfies
the integrator's `requires_rhs`).  Emits a JSON report.  Run under an
opt-in `@pytest.mark.benchmark` so day-to-day CI is unaffected; a
dedicated GitHub Actions workflow runs the suite on a schedule and
surfaces regressions by comparing each run against the prior workflow
run's report.

*Reference solutions are computed inline.*  Where an analytical
solution exists (linear, two-body, etc.), it is the reference.  Where
no analytical solution exists, the reference is computed at test time
by running an integrator from `_INSTANCES` at very tight tolerance.
A session-scoped pytest fixture caches the result so the cost is paid
once per session, not once per parameterized run.  To mitigate the
bootstrap risk of using the integrator family under test to verify
itself, the reference integrator is chosen from a *different family
or order* than the integrator under test wherever the integrator
stack permits: a higher-order RK references a lower-order RK; once
Phase 4 lands, an implicit integrator references an explicit one on
stiff problems where both apply; once multiple families exist they
cross-validate.  For phases where only one family is available,
bootstrap verification is supplemented by the convergence-order
claims from Phase 2 — a method that satisfies its symbolic order
conditions and converges at the predicted rate is unlikely to harbor
a family-wide bug invisible to self-reference.

**Open questions — Epoch 4 design points:**

1. **Coefficient-algebra typing for Phase 8.** Whether to parameterize
   `RungeKuttaIntegrator` over a `Coefficient` type variable (uniform
   surface, every method has the same class) or to introduce
   `ExponentialRKIntegrator` as a sibling class (more readable for the
   common case where coefficients are rationals).  Decision deferred until
   Phase 4 / 5 stabilize the implicit/explicit type story.

2. **Autotuner generalization.** Does the static autotuner from Phase 0
   (`Constant` controller + descriptor-driven `recommended_dt`) survive
   once VODE-style controllers exist in Phase 7, or does Phase 7 subsume
   the static autotuner as the trivial constant-policy case?  Resolves in
   Phase 7.

3. **Stiffness detector reuse.** Phase 7 needs an online ρ(J) estimate;
   Phase 8 may benefit from the same machinery (deciding when `‖hL‖` is
   large enough to justify exponential treatment over fully-explicit).
   Factor into a shared `StiffnessDiagnostic` from Phase 7 onward.

4. **`set_default_backend` vs. solver-level override.** Carried forward
   from the prior epoch.  Time-integrator code must inherit whichever
   resolution lands; a per-`TimeStepper` backend override is the natural
   API extension if process-wide defaults turn out to be insufficient.

**Open questions carried forward into Epoch 4:**

- AMR (Epoch 12): time-stepper must accept hierarchical state once meshes
  refine; integrator state types may need a coarse-fine variant.
- GR (Epoch 13): integrator state and step program become coupled to a
  dynamical 3-metric; the structured-RHS protocol may need a
  `WithMetricRHS` variant.
- Temporal convergence verification across spatial dimensions: spatial
  framework now covers 1D / 2D / 3D; temporal claims should likewise
  verify across problem dimensions where applicable.

## Cross-cutting open questions

Items that are not scoped to any specific epoch.  They surface here so they
are not lost; the decision of when and how to schedule them is made when
the implementation lane becomes clear.

**HDF5 checkpoint/restart.** Persistent serialization of simulation state
(time-stepper state, mesh fields, parameters) with provenance sidecars
(git hash, timestamp, parameter record).  GPU-written checkpoints must be
readable on CPU-only machines.  Not assigned to an epoch; the right time
to schedule depends on which integrator state types end up carrying
non-serializable data and on whether checkpointing arrives as part of a
broader persistence layer or as a standalone capability.

### Per-epoch verification standard

Every epoch must satisfy this checklist before it is considered verified:

- Derivation document with SymPy checks for any new numerical scheme (Lanes B and C)
- At least one externally-grounded convergence test against an analytical solution
  or observational data (not an engine-generated golden file); where an analytical
  solution exists, the relevant `NumericFunction.symbolic` is declared so the
  check runs automatically
- Lane A/B/C classification stated in the PR description
