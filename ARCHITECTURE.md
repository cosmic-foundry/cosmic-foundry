# Cosmic Foundry — Architecture

## Commitments

These are the foundational claims about this repository. Each is a
commitment: the code must satisfy it, tests enforce it where possible,
and any PR that violates a claim must explicitly revise it here rather
than quietly breaking it.

**Cosmic Foundry is a general-purpose PDE simulation engine, optimized
for astrophysical use cases.**

**The mathematical language of the architecture is differential geometry
on spatio-temporal manifolds, with PDE theory as the application layer.**

**Physical quantities are represented as instances of formal mathematical
abstractions.**

**Every numerical method is formally derived from its continuous
mathematical counterpart, and machine-checkable, where possible.**

**Every object that claims to represent a specific physical scenario is paired
with a testable claim about that scenario — symbolic or numerical — that CI can
check. For numerical methods this claim is verification against an analytical
solution, with the test living in this repository.**

**Where external data sources are ingested the uncertainty in that
data is explicitly quantified and propagated.**

**The engine is dimensionless internally.**

## Layer architecture

The codebase is organized into four packages with a strict dependency order:

```
theory/
  foundation/   ←  continuous/
       ↑                ↑
       └──────── discrete/
                     ↑
geometry/   ← concrete instantiable objects (meshes, spacetimes)
    ↑
computation/
```

`foundation/`, `continuous/`, and `discrete/` are nested under `theory/`,
making the symbolic-reasoning boundary a directory boundary. Everything
outside `theory/` (`geometry/`, `computation/`, `validation/`) is the
application/concreteness layer.

**`theory/` and `geometry/` are the symbolic-reasoning layer.**
`foundation/`, `continuous/`, `discrete/`, and `geometry/` all share the same
identity: they describe mathematical structure symbolically, without numerical
evaluation. `geometry/` is coordinate geometry infrastructure — manifolds,
charts, and meshes defined by SymPy expressions; numerical array allocation
belongs in `computation/`. Their import boundary reflects that shared identity —
they may only import from the Python standard library, `cosmic_foundry`, or
packages on the approved symbolic-reasoning list. The approved list is
`{sympy}`. Additions require justification against the symbolic-reasoning
identity; numerical computation packages (JAX, NumPy, SciPy) are excluded by
definition. Enforced by `tests/test_theory_no_third_party_imports.py`.

```

**`Constraint` / `BoundaryCondition` hierarchy.** `LocalBoundaryCondition`
covers Dirichlet (`α=1, β=0`), Neumann (`α=0, β=1`), and Robin via the
unified `α·f + β·∂f/∂n = g` form. `NonLocalBoundaryCondition` makes no
claim about the form of the non-locality; concrete subclasses declare
whatever geometric references they need.

**Class existence is justified by a falsifiable constraint, not anticipation.**
Every ABC in `continuous/` and `foundation/` must earn its place. A new class
is warranted only when it removes a degree of freedom from its parent: either
a derived property (a non-abstract property fully determined by abstract ones)
or a type narrowing that mypy can check. A property describing *regularity* of
`__call__` (continuous, smooth) is not falsifiable in Python's type system and
does not justify a new class.

Concretely: `PseudoRiemannianManifold` earns its place via `ndim =
sum(signature)`; `RiemannianManifold` via `signature = (ndim, 0)`;
`Homeomorphism` by narrowing `domain`/`codomain` to `TopologicalSpace`. A
hypothetical `SmoothMap` would not qualify.

Non-independent objects are co-located in the same file as the object they
belong to. Example: `Chart`, `Atlas`, `Diffeomorphism` in `manifold.py`;
`MetricTensor`, `RiemannianManifold` in `pseudo_riemannian_manifold.py`.

**`ConservationLaw` is spatial only.** `∂ₜ` is handled by the time integrator
(Epoch 2), not this object. This separation is preserved under the 3+1 ADM
decomposition: in GR, covariant equations `∇_μ F^μ = S` decompose to
`∂ₜ(√γ U) + ∂ᵢ(√γ Fⁱ) = √γ S(α, β, γᵢⱼ, Kᵢⱼ)` — still a spatial
divergence operator with metric factors entering through the `Chart` and
curvature terms in `source`. `ConservationLaw` is stable through Epoch 10.

**Planned additions** (Epoch 10)

**`DynamicManifold(PseudoRiemannianManifold)`** — A manifold whose metric
tensor is a dynamical field in the simulation state. Required for full GR
(3+1 ADM formalism): signature is fixed (Lorentzian), but the metric is
evolved by the Einstein equations. In the 3+1 decomposition the
computational domain is a 3-D Riemannian spatial hypersurface; the
3-metric `γ_ij` and extrinsic curvature `K_ij` are evolved fields. The
concrete entry would be `Spacetime3Plus1(DynamicManifold)`. Interface not
yet designed.

**`Connection` / `AffineConnection`** — Covariant derivative; not a tensor
field (inhomogeneous transformation law). Required for curvature
computations and parallel transport.

```

The discrete layer approximates the **integral form** of conservation laws, not
the differential form. The derivation chain grounding every object in this layer:

1. A conservation law in divergence form on a domain Ω ⊂ M: ∂ₜU + ∇·F(U) = S
2. Integrate over each control volume Ωᵢ and apply the divergence theorem:
   ∂ₜ∫_Ωᵢ U dV + ∮_∂Ωᵢ F·n dA = ∫_Ωᵢ S dV
3. Approximate cell averages Ūᵢ ≈ |Ωᵢ|⁻¹ ∫_Ωᵢ U dV and face fluxes at each
   shared interface; this yields the discrete scheme

Finite volume (FVM) is the primary method — every term has a geometric
interpretation (cell volume, face area, face normal) derived from the chart and
the cell decomposition. FDM and FEM are also derivable from this foundation:

- **FDM**: On a Cartesian mesh with midpoint quadrature and piecewise-constant
  reconstruction, FVM reduces to FDM. Finite difference is a special case of
  FVM on regular meshes, not a separate derivation.
- **FEM**: Multiplying by a test function and integrating by parts yields the
  weak formulation; choosing a finite-dimensional function space Vₕ yields FEM.
  Additional machinery (basis functions, bilinear forms, function spaces) extends
  the current foundation; deferred.

**Planned additions (Epoch 1 — Discrete operators):**

                              order p. The commutation check verified algebraically via

                              They share a Mesh parameter and are related by the

### computation/

JAX evaluation. The only layer that touches floats. Planned: concrete field
storage as `jax.Array`; JIT-compiled stencil application; explicit time
integration; HDF5 I/O with provenance.

### Cross-cutting

**Numerical transcription discipline.**
Physics capabilities sourced from reference tables (EOS polynomial fits,
reaction networks, opacity tables) need a discipline governing how
numeric tables are transcribed, verified, and updated independently of
the derivation-first lane policy. This decision is deferred to Epoch 7
(microphysics), when the first such capability lands.

**Kernel composition model.**
A backend-agnostic interface separating kernel computation (Op) from
spatial domain and execution policy (Policy) is a design goal. An
earlier Op/Policy/Dispatch framing was dropped before it was realized.
The formal model governing composition, backend substitutability, and
dispatch is unsettled.

**Physical constants ingestion (CODATA).**
The engine will need physical constants (G, c, ħ, k_B, …) throughout the
physics epochs. The authoritative machine-readable source is NIST CODATA
(public domain), available at `https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/Table/allascii.txt`.
Open questions: where the constants module lives (`foundation/`? `computation/`?)
and whether it must respect the symbolic-reasoning import boundary; how constants
are exposed (SymPy symbols with known numerical values, plain floats, or both);
how the CODATA revision is pinned and updated. WGS 84 / GPS-specific defined
constants (μ, Ω_E, GPS semi-major axis) have no machine-readable API; the
ingestion discipline for PDF-sourced defined constants is a separate decision.

## Current work

**Discrete operators — Epoch 1.**
`DiscreteOperator(NumericFunction[MeshFunction, MeshFunction])` maps a `MeshFunction` to a
`MeshFunction` and earns its class via `.mesh: Mesh` — constraining input and output to the
same mesh, by analogy with `DifferentialOperator.manifold`.
`Discretization(NumericFunction[ConservationLaw, DiscreteOperator])` is the scheme constructor:
free parameters are `law: ConservationLaw`, `mesh: Mesh`, and `order: int`; it produces the
`DiscreteOperator` making the commutation diagram `Lₕ ∘ Rₕ ≈ Rₕ ∘ L` hold to `O(hᵖ)`.
The commutation check is the machine-checkable derivation required by Lane C:
verify via SymPy that Taylor-expanding `Lₕ(Rₕ f) − Rₕ(Lf)` for a symbolic test
function f yields a remainder whose leading term is `O(hᵖ)`.

**Concrete `Rₕ` and `CartesianMesh.boundary()`.** The `RestrictionOperator` ABC is in place;
the concrete subclass for `CartesianMesh` integrates a `SymbolicFunction` analytically via SymPy:
`(Rₕ f)ᵢ = |Ωᵢ|⁻¹ ∫_Ωᵢ f dV`. `CartesianMesh.boundary(k)` (currently `NotImplementedError`)
also lands here — it returns the signed face-incidence map needed to assemble FVM flux sums.
Both are deferred from the discrete structure layer because their implementation pattern is shared
with the truncation-error verification in the Lane C commutation check.

**First Poisson solver.** Target: a working second-order FVM discretization of `∇²φ = ρ` on
a `CartesianMesh` with Dirichlet boundary conditions, verified against `φ = sin(πx)sin(πy)`
via a convergence test demonstrating `O(h²)` error. Lane C (origination); the SymPy commutation check is the machine-checkable derivation.

## Physics roadmap

| Epoch | Layer | Capability |
|-------|-------|------------|

| 15 | Subgrid physics and synthetic observables: plugin interface, in-situ rendering. *(stretch)* |

### Per-epoch verification standard

Every epoch must satisfy this checklist before it is considered verified:

- Derivation document with SymPy checks for any new numerical scheme (Lanes B and C)
- At least one externally-grounded convergence test against an analytical solution
  or observational data (not an engine-generated golden file); where an analytical
  solution exists, the relevant `NumericFunction.symbolic` is declared so the
  check runs automatically
- Lane A/B/C classification stated in the PR description
