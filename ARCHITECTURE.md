# Cosmic Foundry — Architecture

## Commitments

These are the foundational claims about this repository. Each is a
commitment: the code must satisfy it, tests enforce it where possible,
and any PR that violates a claim must explicitly revise it here rather
than quietly breaking it.

**Cosmic Foundry is a general-purpose PDE simulation engine, optimized
for astrophysical use cases.**

**The mathematical language of the architecture is differential geometry
on spatio-temporal manifolds, with PDE theory as the application layer.**

**Physical quantities are represented as instances of formal mathematical
abstractions.**

**Every numerical method is formally derived from its continuous
mathematical counterpart, and machine-checkable, where possible.**

**Every object that claims to represent a specific physical scenario is paired
with a testable claim about that scenario — symbolic or numerical — that CI can
check. For numerical methods this claim is verification against an analytical
solution, with the test living in this repository.**

**Where external data sources are ingested the uncertainty in that
data is explicitly quantified and propagated.**

**The engine is dimensionless internally.**

## Layer architecture

The codebase is organized into five packages with a strict dependency order:

```
theory/
  foundation/ ←── continuous/ ←── discrete/
                                        ↑         ↑
                                   geometry/   computation/
                                        ↑         ↑
                                        └─physics/─┘
```

`A ←── B` means B imports from A (B sits above A in the stack).
`computation/` has no imports from `theory/` or `geometry/`; the two
paths into `physics/` are independent.

`foundation/`, `continuous/`, and `discrete/` are nested under `theory/`,
making the symbolic-reasoning boundary a directory boundary.

**`theory/` and `geometry/` are the symbolic-reasoning layer.**
`foundation/`, `continuous/`, `discrete/`, and `geometry/` all share the same
identity: they describe mathematical structure symbolically, without numerical
evaluation. `geometry/` is coordinate geometry infrastructure — manifolds,
charts, and meshes defined by SymPy expressions; numerical array allocation
belongs in `computation/`. Their import boundary reflects that shared identity —
they may only import from the Python standard library, `cosmic_foundry`, or
packages on the approved symbolic-reasoning list. The approved list is
`{sympy}`. Additions require justification against the symbolic-reasoning
identity; numerical computation packages (JAX, NumPy, SciPy) are excluded by
definition. Enforced by `tests/test_theory_no_third_party_imports.py`.

**`physics/` is the application/concreteness layer.** It implements specific
physical models (PDE operators, discretization schemes) and houses `State`,
the concrete simulation-state type that couples mesh geometry with numeric
storage via `computation/`. `physics/` may import from all other packages.

**`computation/` is the numeric machinery layer.** It must not import from
`theory/` or `geometry/` or `physics/`; enforced by
`scripts/ci/check_computation_imports.py`. All numeric library imports
(`math`, `numpy`, `jax`, etc.) are confined here; enforced by
`scripts/ci/check_numeric_imports.py`.

                              Lₕ ∘ Rₕ ≈ Rₕ ∘ L hold to the chosen order.
                              Earns its class via two falsifiable claims:
                                order: int — composite convergence order
                                continuous_operator: DifferentialOperator —
                                  the continuous operator this approximates
                                  (threaded automatically by Discretization
                                  from its input L)
                              Not independently constructed from stencil
                              coefficients; produced by a Discretization.

NumericalFlux(DiscreteOperator)
                            — a DiscreteOperator with the cell-average →
                              face-flux calling convention:
                                __call__(U: DiscreteField) → FaceField
                              where U holds cell-average values.  The
                              returned FaceField is indexed as
                              result((axis, idx_low)) and returns the flux
                              F·n̂·|face_area| at that face.  Inherits order
                              and continuous_operator from DiscreteOperator.

DiscreteExteriorDerivative(ABC)
                            — NOT a DiscreteOperator; exact chain map, no truncation
                              error. Interface: mesh: Mesh, degree: int,
                              __call__(field: DiscreteField) → DiscreteField.
                              d∘d = 0 exactly (algebraic identity).
                              Does not carry order or continuous_operator because
                              it is not an approximation — it is exact by construction.

### computation/

The only layer that may import numeric libraries (`math`, `numpy`, `jax`,
etc.); all other layers are restricted to the Python standard library and
approved symbolic packages. Enforced by `scripts/ci/check_numeric_imports.py`.
Must not import from `theory/`, `geometry/`, or `physics/`; enforced by
`scripts/ci/check_computation_imports.py`.

```
Real(Protocol)      — scalar numeric protocol; satisfied by float, int,
                      numpy.float16/32/64, JAX scalars. Covers exactly the
                      arithmetic operations Tensor applies to its elements.

Tensor              — arbitrary-rank numeric array backed by a pluggable
                      Backend. Single public API over multiple storage
                      strategies. Supports construction, indexing,
                      arithmetic (+, −, *, /), einsum, matmul, norm, diag,
                      SVD, copy, to_list, and to(backend). Rank-0 through
                      rank-n; all shapes uniform (no jagged arrays).

Backend(Protocol)   — per-instance dispatch strategy. Mixed-backend
                      arithmetic raises ValueError. Backends:

    PythonBackend   — nested Python lists; reference implementation;
                      no external dependencies. Leaf values are unconstrained
                      Python objects, so sympy.Expr leaves work transparently
                      (used by the symbolic order-proof path in physics/).
    NumpyBackend(dtype=None)
                    — NumPy ndarray; dtype inferred from input by default
                      or fixed to an explicit numpy dtype; vectorized via
                      BLAS/LAPACK.
    JaxBackend      — JAX array; planned (Epoch 3, C5).

LinearSolver        — mesh-agnostic interface: solve(a: Tensor, b: Tensor) → Tensor.
                      Accepts an assembled N×N stiffness matrix and an N-vector
                      RHS; returns the solution vector. Assembly and index mapping
                      are the caller's responsibility, keeping computation/ free
                      of theory/discrete/ and physics/ dependencies.
                      SCOPE: linear operators only. Epoch 5 hydro (nonlinear
                      flux) requires a separate NonlinearSolver / Newton
                      iteration. LinearSolver is not the shared machinery
                      for Epoch 5; only FVMDiscretization and NumericalFlux
                      are reused across epochs.
                      Ships DenseJacobiSolver (weighted Jacobi, ω derived
                      from Gershgorin bound; works for both order=2 and
                      order=4 stencils) and DenseLUSolver (direct, in-place
                      LU with partial pivoting). Both operate on Tensor;
                      linear algebra hand-rolled, no LAPACK. Convergence
                      tests cap at N ≤ 32 in 2-D (≤ 1024 unknowns).
```

**Planned additions (Epoch 3):** `JaxBackend`; explicit time integrators
(`RungeKutta2`, `RungeKutta4`); HDF5 checkpoint/restart with provenance sidecars.

### Cross-cutting

**Kernel composition model.**
Realized as the `Backend` protocol in `computation/backends/`. `Tensor`
is the single public interface; `Backend` is the strategy that governs
storage and execution. Backends are per-instance; dispatch is
identity-checked (`is`), not type-checked, so user-defined backends
satisfying the protocol are first-class. Open questions: `@jax.jit`
tracing policy for `JaxBackend` (per-call JIT vs. solver-level JIT);
whether `set_default_backend` is sufficient for solver-level selection
or a solver-level override is needed.

---

## Current work: Epoch 3 — Computation layer

**Target.** A fully-capable, backend-agnostic computation layer: `Tensor`
operating on any registered backend (Python, NumPy, JAX), with JAX enabling
GPU/TPU execution and JIT compilation of full solve loops, plus the explicit
time integration needed by Epoch 4 hydro.

**C1 — Pure-Python Tensor class. ✓** Arbitrary-rank numeric array backed by
nested lists. `Real` protocol. `einsum` general contraction. `__matmul__` fast
paths for dot, vecmat, matvec, matmul; `einsum` fallback for exotic ranks.
Multi-index `__getitem__`/`__setitem__`. Element-wise `*`, `/`. `copy()`,
`norm()`, `diag()`, `svd()` (one-sided Jacobi). Solvers and discretization
migrated to operate on `Tensor` throughout.

**C2 — Numeric import boundary. ✓** `scripts/ci/check_numeric_imports.py`
(AST-based) enforces that `math`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `jax`, `torch` appear
only under `computation/`. Wired into `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

**C3 — Roofline performance regression gate. ✓**
`tests/test_performance.py`: session-scoped fixture measures the machine's
pure-Python FMA rate at startup; 8 claims assert each operation completes
within `EFFICIENCY_FACTOR = 8` of the roofline prediction. Self-calibrating.

**C4 — Backend protocol: PythonBackend + NumpyBackend. ✓** `Backend` protocol
in `computation/backends/`; `Tensor` accepts `backend=` at construction;
`Tensor.to(backend)` converts; `PythonBackend` wraps existing pure-Python
logic; `NumpyBackend(dtype=None)` uses NumPy with dtype inferred from input
by default. Mixed-backend arithmetic raises `ValueError`. 38 backend
correctness claims in `tests/test_tensor_backends.py`.

**C5 — JaxBackend. ✓** `JaxBackend` in `computation/backends/jax_backend.py`
satisfies the `Backend` protocol using JAX arrays.  JAX arrays are immutable;
`slice_set` uses `.at[idx].set(value)` and returns the updated array.
`Tensor.__setitem__` now routes all index types through `backend.slice_set`,
reassigning `self._data` with the result — this is the only interface change
needed to support both mutable (Python/NumPy) and immutable (JAX) backends.
Backend correctness claims in `test_tensor_backends.py` extended to cover
`JaxBackend` for all claim types (roundtrip, arithmetic, conversion, slice,
factory, mixed-backend).  **JIT scope decision**: `@jax.jit` is not applied
per `Backend` method call; the caller applies it at the solver or time-step
level.  Tracing a full solve loop requires all shape/rank branches to be
static, which is a separate refactor deferred to C8 when the time integrator
provides a natural JIT boundary.

**C6 — Backend parity and performance. ✓ (NumpyBackend)** Added
`_NumpyParityPerfClaim` and `_BackendSpeedupClaim` to `test_performance.py`.
`_NumpyParityPerfClaim` asserts NumpyBackend Tensor overhead ≤
`NUMPY_PARITY_FACTOR = 2` of raw `np.matmul`/`np.matvec` for N ∈ {8, 16, 32}.
`_BackendSpeedupClaim` asserts NumpyBackend is at least 10× faster than
PythonBackend for matmul (N ∈ {8, 16, 32}) and 5× for matvec (N ∈ {16, 32}),
catching regressions where NumPy is accidentally bypassed.  JaxBackend
performance claims (GPU vs CPU) deferred to C8, where `@jax.jit` provides
the natural JIT boundary that makes JAX competitive.

**C7 — Collapse LazyDiscreteField. ✓** `LazyDiscreteField` deleted.
`FaceField` covers all face-indexed fields; `_BasisField` (private to
`Discretization`) is a `DiscreteField` unit basis for `assemble()`.
Ghost-cell extension is handled by `DirichletGhostCells` and `PeriodicGhostCells`
(concrete `DiscreteBoundaryCondition` subclasses).  All convergence claims pass.

**C8 — Explicit time integrators.** `TimeIntegrator` ABC; `RungeKutta2` and
`RungeKutta4`. Backend-agnostic; operates on `State`-valued fields. Lane B
derivation: truncation error O(hᵖ), p = 2, 4, confirmed symbolically.

**C9 — HDF5 checkpoint/restart.** Write/read `State`-valued fields with
provenance sidecars (git hash, timestamp, parameter record). GPU-written
checkpoints readable on CPU-only machines.

**Open questions — Epoch 3 design points:**

1. **`set_default_backend` vs. solver-level override.** The current design
   sets a process-wide default. If two solvers in the same process need different
   backends (e.g., CPU for assembly, GPU for iteration), a per-solver backend
   argument to `LinearSolver.solve` may be needed. Deferred to C7.

**Open questions carried forward into Epoch 3:**

- AMR (Epoch 11): fixed-mesh `Discretization` will need hierarchical extension.
- GR (Epoch 12): face geometry is state-dependent when the 3-metric is a dynamical field.
- Multi-dimensional convergence sweep: currently 1-D only; 2-D/3-D deferred.

### Per-epoch verification standard

Every epoch must satisfy this checklist before it is considered verified:

- Derivation document with SymPy checks for any new numerical scheme (Lanes B and C)
- At least one externally-grounded convergence test against an analytical solution
  or observational data (not an engine-generated golden file); where an analytical
  solution exists, the relevant `NumericFunction.symbolic` is declared so the
  check runs automatically
- Lane A/B/C classification stated in the PR description
