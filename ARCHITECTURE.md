# Cosmic Foundry — Architecture

## Commitments

These are the foundational claims about this repository. Each is a
commitment: the code must satisfy it, tests enforce it where possible,
and any PR that violates a claim must explicitly revise it here rather
than quietly breaking it.

**Cosmic Foundry is a general-purpose PDE simulation engine, optimized
for astrophysical use cases.**

**The mathematical language of the architecture is differential geometry
on spatio-temporal manifolds, with PDE theory as the application layer.**

**Physical quantities are represented as instances of formal mathematical
abstractions.**

**Every numerical method is formally derived from its continuous
mathematical counterpart, and machine-checkable, where possible.**

**Every object that claims to represent a specific physical scenario is paired
with a testable claim about that scenario — symbolic or numerical — that CI can
check. For numerical methods this claim is verification against an analytical
solution, with the test living in this repository.**

**Where external data sources are ingested the uncertainty in that
data is explicitly quantified and propagated.**

**The engine is dimensionless internally.**

## Layer architecture

The codebase is organized into four packages with a strict dependency order:

```
foundation/   ←  continuous/
     ↑                ↑
     └──────── discrete/ (Epoch 2, not yet implemented)
                        ↑
                  computation/
```

**`foundation/` and `continuous/` are symbolic-reasoning layers.**
Their shared identity: they describe mathematical structure symbolically, without
numerical evaluation. Their import boundary reflects that identity — they may
only import from the Python standard library, `cosmic_foundry`, or packages on
the approved symbolic-reasoning list. The approved list is `{sympy}`. Additions
require justification against the symbolic-reasoning identity; numerical
computation packages (JAX, NumPy, SciPy) are excluded by definition. Enforced
by `tests/test_theory_no_third_party_imports.py`.

    └── NonLocalBoundaryCondition     — constraint depends on values outside the immediate neighborhood
```

**`Constraint` / `BoundaryCondition` hierarchy.** `LocalBoundaryCondition`
covers Dirichlet (`α=1, β=0`), Neumann (`α=0, β=1`), and Robin via the
unified `α·f + β·∂f/∂n = g` form. `NonLocalBoundaryCondition` makes no
claim about the form of the non-locality; concrete subclasses declare
whatever geometric references they need.

**Class existence is justified by a falsifiable constraint, not anticipation.**
Every ABC in `continuous/` and `foundation/` must earn its place. A new class
is warranted only when it removes a degree of freedom from its parent: either
a derived property (a non-abstract property fully determined by abstract ones)
or a type narrowing that mypy can check. A property describing *regularity* of
`__call__` (continuous, smooth) is not falsifiable in Python's type system and
does not justify a new class.

Concretely: `PseudoRiemannianManifold` earns its place via `ndim =
sum(signature)`; `RiemannianManifold` via `signature = (ndim, 0)`;
`Homeomorphism` by narrowing `domain`/`codomain` to `TopologicalSpace`. A
hypothetical `SmoothMap` would not qualify.

Non-independent objects are co-located in the same file as the object they
belong to. Example: `Chart`, `Atlas`, `Diffeomorphism` in `manifold.py`;
`MetricTensor`, `RiemannianManifold` in `pseudo_riemannian_manifold.py`.

**Planned additions** (Epoch 12)

**`DynamicManifold(PseudoRiemannianManifold)`** — A manifold whose metric
tensor is a dynamical field in the simulation state. Required for full GR
(3+1 ADM formalism): signature is fixed (Lorentzian), but the metric is
evolved by the Einstein equations. In the 3+1 decomposition the
computational domain is a 3-D Riemannian spatial hypersurface; the
3-metric `γ_ij` and extrinsic curvature `K_ij` are evolved fields. The
concrete entry would be `Spacetime3Plus1(DynamicManifold)`. Interface not
yet designed.

**`Connection` / `AffineConnection`** — Covariant derivative; not a tensor
field (inhomogeneous transformation law). Required for curvature
computations and parallel transport.

**Open questions**

**What is the formal PDE object in the continuous layer?**
Conservation laws like ∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρv) = 0 are statements about continuous
fields. Before discretizing, we may want to express them as formal objects in
`continuous/`. The right interface is unclear and may only become clear once we
have a working discretization to invert from.

**What do SymPy-backed continuous objects look like?**
The open case is coordinate-dependent fields: a concrete `ScalarField` backed
by a SymPy expression `f(x, y) = sin(πx)sin(πy)` where the coordinate symbols
`x, y` are tied to a specific chart. The interface for coordinate-dependent
SymPy-backed fields (evaluatable analytical forms, coordinate-to-chart binding)
is not yet designed. Concrete field implementations live outside `continuous/`
— either in test fixtures or in `computation/` once the numerical layer lands.

### discrete/  · Epochs 2–3

Not yet implemented. The earlier `DiscreteField` ABC was removed: it predated
the `Chart`/`Atlas` machinery and did not self-consistently arise from
`foundation/` and `continuous/`. In particular, `approximates` baked the
approximation relationship into the discrete object, but that relationship
involves three parties — the continuous field, the grid, and the discretization
scheme — and cannot be a property of one alone.

**Planned** (Epoch 2): `CartesianGrid` as a concrete `IndexedSet` with
coordinate geometry; cell and face structure. Grid functions as
`Function[CartesianGrid, V]`. The approximation relationship deferred until a
real discretization scheme is in place to express it against.

**Planned** (Epoch 3): Discrete differential operators: stencil coefficients
derived from continuous operators via SymPy; truncation error verified
algebraically; formal operator composition on the grid.

**Open questions**

**What is the right ABC for a grid function?**
A grid function is `Function[IndexedSet, V]`. The open question is whether a
named subclass (analogous to `Field(Function[Manifold, V])`) is warranted, and
if so what derived property earns it a class under the falsifiable-constraint
rule.

**Is scheme choice a first-class concept?**
A finite-difference discretization of ∇² is a precise mathematical act: choose
a grid, choose an approximation order, derive stencil coefficients. Whether a
formal `Discretization` — a callable that maps a `DifferentialOperator` + grid
+ order to a discrete stencil — belongs in `discrete/`, or whether scheme
choice remains implicit in how discrete objects are constructed, is unsettled.
The chart on the ambient manifold provides the coordinate map that grounds the
derivation; a first-class `Discretization` would reference it.

### computation/  · Epoch 4

JAX evaluation. The only layer that touches floats. Planned: concrete field
storage as `jax.Array`; JIT-compiled stencil application; explicit time
integration; HDF5 I/O with provenance.

**Open question**

**Kernel composition model.**
A backend-agnostic interface separating kernel computation (Op) from
spatial domain and execution policy (Policy) is a design goal. An
earlier Op/Policy/Dispatch framing was dropped before it was realized.
The formal model governing composition, backend substitutability, and
dispatch is unsettled.

### Cross-cutting

**Numerical transcription discipline.**
Physics capabilities sourced from reference tables (EOS polynomial fits,
reaction networks, opacity tables) need a discipline governing how
numeric tables are transcribed, verified, and updated independently of
the derivation-first lane policy. This decision is deferred to Epoch 7
(microphysics), when the first such capability lands.

## Current work

**M3: Executable mathematical narrative.**
The first `verification/` implementations are GR spacetimes: `SchwarzschildSpacetime`
with a SymPy-backed metric, GPS time dilation derivation, and Schwarzschild
embedding diagram. Each is a concrete `PseudoRiemannianManifold` alongside
SymPy assertions that CI executes. Notebooks in `docs/` import directly from
`verification/` — no class definitions in notebooks. Open questions to settle
during implementation: coordinate-to-chart binding (which SymPy symbols belong
to which `Chart`), and how `symbols` is declared on concrete `Field` subclasses.

**Epoch 2 design session: how do physical coordinates attach to a grid?**
The first concrete implementation is a Cartesian grid (`CartesianGrid` as a
concrete `IndexedSet` with coordinate geometry). The chart formalism is in
place: `Chart(Function)` maps manifold points to ℝⁿ. But a `CartesianGrid` is
a concrete `IndexedSet`, not a manifold — so a `Chart` cannot directly act on
it. The design question is: what object maps grid indices to physical
coordinates, and how does it relate to the chart on the ambient manifold?
Settling this unblocks the grid-function approximation relationship and the
SymPy-backed field interface (what coordinate symbols does the expression use?).

## Physics roadmap

Each physics epoch adds new fields and equations to the continuous layer and
extends the discrete and numerical layers minimally to evaluate them.

### Per-epoch verification standard

Every physics epoch must satisfy this checklist before it is considered verified:

- Derivation document with SymPy checks for any new numerical scheme (Lanes B and C)
- At least one externally-grounded convergence test against an analytical solution
  or observational data (not an engine-generated golden file); where an analytical
  solution exists, the relevant `NumericFunction.symbolic` is declared so the
  check runs automatically
- Lane A/B/C classification stated in the PR description
