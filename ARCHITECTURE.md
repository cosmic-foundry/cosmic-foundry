# Cosmic Foundry — Architecture

## Commitments

These are the foundational claims about this repository. Each is a
commitment: the code must satisfy it, tests enforce it where possible,
and any PR that violates a claim must explicitly revise it here rather
than quietly breaking it.

**Cosmic Foundry is a general-purpose PDE simulation engine, optimized
for astrophysical use cases.**

**The mathematical language of the architecture is differential geometry
on spatio-temporal manifolds, with PDE theory as the application layer.**

**Physical quantities are represented as instances of formal mathematical
abstractions.**

**Every numerical method is formally derived from its continuous
mathematical counterpart, and machine-checkable, where possible.**

**Every object that claims to represent a specific physical scenario is paired
with a testable claim about that scenario — symbolic or numerical — that CI can
check. For numerical methods this claim is verification against an analytical
solution, with the test living in this repository.**

**Where external data sources are ingested the uncertainty in that
data is explicitly quantified and propagated.**

**The engine is dimensionless internally.**

## Layer architecture

The codebase is organized into five packages with a strict dependency order:

```
theory/
  foundation/ ←── continuous/ ←── discrete/
                                        ↑         ↑
                                   geometry/   computation/
                                        ↑         ↑
                                        └─physics/─┘
```

`A ←── B` means B imports from A (B sits above A in the stack).
`computation/` has no imports from `theory/` or `geometry/`; the two
paths into `physics/` are independent.

`foundation/`, `continuous/`, and `discrete/` are nested under `theory/`,
making the symbolic-reasoning boundary a directory boundary.

**`theory/` and `geometry/` are the symbolic-reasoning layer.**
`foundation/`, `continuous/`, `discrete/`, and `geometry/` all share the same
identity: they describe mathematical structure symbolically, without numerical
evaluation. `geometry/` is coordinate geometry infrastructure — manifolds,
charts, and meshes defined by SymPy expressions; numerical array allocation
belongs in `computation/`. Their import boundary reflects that shared identity —
they may only import from the Python standard library, `cosmic_foundry`, or
packages on the approved symbolic-reasoning list. The approved list is
`{sympy}`. Additions require justification against the symbolic-reasoning
identity; numerical computation packages (JAX, NumPy, SciPy) are excluded by
definition. Enforced by `tests/test_theory_no_third_party_imports.py`.

**`physics/` is the application/concreteness layer.** It implements specific
physical models (PDE operators, discretization schemes). `physics/` may import
from all other packages.

**`computation/` is the numeric machinery layer.** It must not import from
`theory/` or `geometry/` or `physics/`; enforced by
`scripts/ci/check_computation_imports.py`. All numeric library imports
(`math`, `numpy`, `jax`, etc.) are confined here; enforced by
`scripts/ci/check_numeric_imports.py`.

                                Discretization: DiscreteField → DiscreteField
                                NumericalFlux:  DiscreteField → FaceField
                              Earns its class via two falsifiable claims:
                                order: int — composite convergence order
                                continuous_operator: DifferentialOperator —
                                  the continuous operator this approximates
                                  (threaded automatically by Discretization
                                  from its input L)
                              Not independently constructed from stencil
                              coefficients; produced by a Discretization.

NumericalFlux(DiscreteOperator[DiscreteField, FaceField])
                            — cell-average → face-flux operator:
                                __call__(U: DiscreteField) → FaceField
                              where U holds cell-average values.  The
                              returned FaceField is indexed as
                              result((axis, idx_low)) and returns the flux
                              F·n̂·|face_area| at that face.  Inherits order
                              and continuous_operator from DiscreteOperator.

DiscreteExteriorDerivative(ABC)
                            — NOT a DiscreteOperator; exact chain map, no truncation
                              error. Interface: mesh: Mesh, degree: int,
                              __call__(field: DiscreteField) → DiscreteField.
                              d∘d = 0 exactly (algebraic identity).
                              Does not carry order or continuous_operator because
                              it is not an approximation — it is exact by construction.

### computation/

The only layer that may import numeric libraries (`math`, `numpy`, `jax`,
etc.); all other layers are restricted to the Python standard library and
approved symbolic packages. Enforced by `scripts/ci/check_numeric_imports.py`.
Must not import from `theory/`, `geometry/`, or `physics/`; enforced by
`scripts/ci/check_computation_imports.py`.

```
Real(Protocol)      — scalar numeric protocol; satisfied by float, int,
                      numpy.float16/32/64, JAX scalars. Covers exactly the
                      arithmetic operations Tensor applies to its elements.

Tensor              — arbitrary-rank numeric array backed by a pluggable
                      Backend. Single public API over multiple storage
                      strategies. Supports construction, indexing,
                      arithmetic (+, −, *, /), einsum, matmul, norm, diag,
                      SVD, copy, to_list, and to(backend). Rank-0 through
                      rank-n; all shapes uniform (no jagged arrays).

Backend(Protocol)   — per-instance dispatch strategy. Mixed-backend
                      arithmetic raises ValueError. Backends:

    PythonBackend   — nested Python lists; reference implementation;
                      no external dependencies. Leaf values are unconstrained
                      Python objects, so sympy.Expr leaves work transparently
                      (used by the symbolic order-proof path in physics/).
    NumpyBackend(dtype=None)
                    — NumPy ndarray; dtype inferred from input by default
                      or fixed to an explicit numpy dtype; vectorized via
                      BLAS/LAPACK.
    JaxBackend      — JAX array; immutable functional updates routed through
                      `Tensor.__setitem__` via `slice_set`. Caller is responsible
                      for `@jax.jit` placement at solver / time-step granularity.

LinearSolver        — mesh-agnostic interface: solve(a: Tensor, b: Tensor) → Tensor.
                      Accepts an assembled N×N stiffness matrix and an N-vector
                      RHS; returns the solution vector. Assembly and index mapping
                      are the caller's responsibility, keeping computation/ free
                      of theory/discrete/ and physics/ dependencies.
                      SCOPE: linear operators only. Epoch 6 hydro (nonlinear
                      flux) requires a separate NonlinearSolver / Newton
                      iteration. LinearSolver is not the shared machinery
                      for Epoch 6; only DivergenceFormDiscretization and NumericalFlux
                      are reused across epochs.
                      Ships DenseJacobiSolver (weighted Jacobi, ω derived
                      from Gershgorin bound; works for both order=2 and
                      order=4 stencils) and DenseLUSolver (direct, in-place
                      LU with partial pivoting). Both operate on Tensor;
                      linear algebra hand-rolled, no LAPACK. Convergence
                      tests cap at N ≤ 32 in 2-D (≤ 1024 unknowns).
```

**Time-integration layer** (`computation/time_integrators/`).  A typed,
modular layer supporting explicit RK, implicit DIRK, IMEX, exponential,
multistep (Adams / BDF), variable-order, symplectic, and operator-splitting
families through a common six-axis DSL (RHS protocol, state, step program,
coefficient algebra, controller, verification primitives).

### Cross-cutting

**Kernel composition model.**
Realized as the `Backend` protocol in `computation/backends/`. `Tensor`
is the single public interface; `Backend` is the strategy that governs
storage and execution. Backends are per-instance; dispatch is
identity-checked (`is`), not type-checked, so user-defined backends
satisfying the protocol are first-class. Open questions: `@jax.jit`
tracing policy for `JaxBackend` (per-call JIT vs. solver-level JIT);
whether `set_default_backend` is sufficient for solver-level selection
or a solver-level override is needed.

## Epoch 4 — Time integration verification (complete)

The nuclear astrophysics stress-test sprint (F1–F5) is complete.  The
infrastructure below is the foundation for Epoch 9 microphysics work.

#### Design principle

`AutoIntegrator` is the single correct entry point.  The caller expresses
the mathematical structure of the RHS via the appropriate protocol;
`AutoIntegrator` dispatches to the correct family from there.  No phase
ever calls an explicit integrator on a problem whose RHS structure calls
for an implicit one.

---

#### `ReactionNetworkRHS` protocol

A new RHS protocol sitting above `JacobianRHS` in the hierarchy, exposing
the factored structure of a system of paired forward/reverse reactions:

```
ReactionNetworkRHS(JacobianRHS)

    stoichiometry_matrix          # S: (n_species × n_reactions), integer
    forward_rate(t, X) → Tensor   # r⁺: n_reactions-vector, ≥ 0 for X ≥ 0
    reverse_rate(t, X) → Tensor   # r⁻: derived from r⁺ via detailed balance,
                                  #     not independently specified

    # Enforced at construction:
    # - reverse_rate is computed from forward_rate and thermodynamic data
    #   (partition functions / binding energies / free energies) via the
    #   detailed balance relation.  This guarantees the fully-equilibrated
    #   network recovers the correct thermodynamic fixed point.
    # - forward_rate(t, X) ≥ 0 for all t, X ≥ 0.

    # Derived at construction, not recomputed at runtime:
    conservation_basis            # left null space of S;
                                  # shape (n_conserved, n_species)
    conservation_targets          # w·X₀ for each conservation row w
    constraint_basis              # independent subset of the m pairwise
                                  # equilibrium conditions {r⁺ⱼ = r⁻ⱼ};
                                  # rank ≤ n_species − n_conserved

    # Implied interface:
    # __call__(t, X) = S @ (r⁺(t, X) − r⁻(t, X))
```

`AutoIntegrator` checks `ReactionNetworkRHS` before `JacobianRHS` (subtype
specificity), routing to the constraint-aware path rather than the plain
implicit-RK path.

The protocol is not nuclear-specific.  Any system of coupled forward/reverse
reactions — chemical kinetics, nuclear burning, radiative processes — satisfies
it.  The stoichiometry analysis is identical regardless of what the species
physically are.

#### New integrator infrastructure

Four additions to the time integration layer, each introduced in the
corresponding problem phase.  `TimeIntegrator.step(rhs, state, dt) → ODEState`
does not change signature; the new machinery lives in the state type,
the Newton kernel, and the controller.

**Conservation projection** (introduced in F2).  A free function
`project_conserved(X, basis, targets) → Tensor` returning the nearest point
in the conservation hyperplane {X : basis · X = targets}.  The projection is
orthogonal: X′ = X − basisᵀ (basis basisᵀ)⁻¹ (basis · X − targets).
Cost is O(n_conserved² · n_species); applied once per accepted step by
the controller.

**Constraint activation state in `ODEState`** (introduced in F4).  A new
optional field `active_constraints: frozenset[int] | None` on `ODEState`.
`None` (the default for all existing code) means no constraint tracking.
A frozenset of reaction-pair indices means those pairs are currently treated
as algebraic constraints.  The integrator passes this field through without
interpreting it; the controller and RHS read and write it.

**Projected Newton iteration** (introduced in F3).  `newton_solve` gains
an optional `constraint_gradients: Tensor | None` argument (shape
k × n_species, the gradients of the k active algebraic constraints).
When provided, each Newton step δX is projected onto the null space of the
active constraint gradients before being applied:
δX ← δX − Cᵀ(CCᵀ)⁻¹ C · δX.
When `None`, existing behavior is preserved exactly.

**`ConstraintAwareController`** (introduced in F4).  Wraps an existing
step-size controller (`PIController` or `VODEController`) and adds
constraint lifecycle management between accepted steps:
- evaluates |r⁺ⱼ − r⁻ⱼ| / max(r⁺ⱼ, r⁻ⱼ) per reaction pair;
- activates a constraint when the ratio falls below ε_activate and
  deactivates when it rises above ε_deactivate (hysteresis prevents
  chattering);
- applies consistent initialization — projects the state onto the
  newly-activated constraint manifold — before the next step;
- calls `project_conserved` after each accepted step;
- detects the NSE limit (rank of active constraint set equals
  n_species − n_conserved) and switches to a direct Newton solve on
  the n_conserved-dimensional conservation-law system.

#### Problem ladder

Each phase introduces one infrastructure piece, tests it on a synthetic
toy problem, and exercises the growing stack on a harder physics problem.
All tests register in `tests/test_time_integrators.py`.

| Phase | Physics problem | Infrastructure introduced | Synthetic tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 ✓ | n-species decay chain (Aₙ → Aₙ₊₁, linear; `BlackBoxRHS`) | `ReactionNetworkRHS` protocol; stoichiometry analysis; conservation law derivation | 2-species A⇌B toy: verify S, conservation_basis = left null space of S, factored form __call__ = S·(r⁺−r⁻), detailed balance at equilibrium |
| F2 ✓ | Two-body fusion A + A → B (quadratic; `BlackBoxRHS`) | `project_conserved` | 3-species toy: orthogonal projection onto Σxᵢ = 1; idempotence; minimum-norm property; round-trip error ≤ ε_machine |
| F3 ✓ | Robertson problem (k₁=0.04, k₂=3×10⁷, k₃=10⁴; `JacobianRHS`) | Projected Newton iteration | 2D system with one hard algebraic constraint: Newton steps stay on constraint manifold; result agrees with exact reduced 1D Newton to integration tolerance |
| F4 ✓ | 5-isotope α-chain at fixed T (`ReactionNetworkRHS`) | Constraint activation state in `ODEState`; `ConstraintAwareController` | A⇌B toy: constraint activates when r⁺/r⁻→1; consistent initialization lands on manifold; hysteresis prevents chattering; deactivation restores ODE trajectory |
| F5 ✓ | 3-species A⇌B⇌C symmetric network (`ReactionNetworkRHS`) | `nonlinear_solve` in `_newton.py`; `solve_nse` in `constraint_aware.py`; NSE limit detection and direct NSE solve in `ConstraintAwareController`; absent-species rate-threshold guard in `_equilibrium_ratios` | A⇌B⇌C toy: both constraints activate simultaneously, `solve_nse` recovers A=B=C=1/3 to machine precision; 11-species hub-and-spoke: fast and slow spoke groups activate at distinct times (staggered activation), `nse_events` logged at full NSE, final Aᵢ=1/11; rate-threshold guard prevents spurious activation of absent-species pairs in chain topology |

#### Invariants upheld by this layer

- **Conservation is a hard pass criterion.**  Any integrator or controller
  that violates conservation beyond floating-point precision is a defect,
  not a known limitation.  `project_conserved` enforces this after every
  accepted step.
- **Constraint chattering is prevented by hysteresis.**  ε_activate = 0.01,
  ε_deactivate = 0.10 (10× ratio) was sufficient for all F4–F5 test
  problems.  Widen the gap if chattering is observed on non-monotone problems.
- **Dense Newton is O(n³).**  Acceptable for n ≤ O(100); sparse factorization
  belongs to Epoch 9 when production-scale networks arrive.

## Cross-cutting open questions

Items that are not scoped to any specific epoch.  They surface here so they
are not lost; the decision of when and how to schedule them is made when
the implementation lane becomes clear.

**`set_default_backend` vs. solver-level override (Epoch 4 carry-over).**
Time-integrator code currently inherits the process-wide default backend set
by `set_default_backend`.  If per-`Integrator` backend overrides are needed
(e.g., a JAX backend for one integrator while the rest use NumPy), a
keyword argument on `Integrator.__init__` is the natural extension point.
Defer until a concrete use case requires it.

**AMR integration state (Epoch 12 forward).**  The time-stepper must accept
hierarchical state once meshes refine.  Integrator state types (`ODEState`,
`NordsieckHistory`) may need coarse–fine variants that carry per-level
sub-states.  Defer until the AMR mesh hierarchy is defined.

**GR integrator coupling (Epoch 13 forward).**  Integrator state and step
program become coupled to a dynamical 3-metric; the structured-RHS protocol
may need a `WithMetricRHS` variant.  Defer until the GR lane begins.

**Temporal convergence across spatial dimensions.**  The convergence
framework verifies time-integration order on scalar and small-vector problems.
Once spatial dimensions are coupled (Epoch 5+), temporal claims should be
re-verified on 2D and 3D problems.

**HDF5 checkpoint/restart.** Persistent serialization of simulation state
(time-stepper state, mesh fields, parameters) with provenance sidecars
(git hash, timestamp, parameter record).  GPU-written checkpoints must be
readable on CPU-only machines.  Not assigned to an epoch; the right time
to schedule depends on which integrator state types end up carrying
non-serializable data and on whether checkpointing arrives as part of a
broader persistence layer or as a standalone capability.

## Current work

### Verification harness migration sprint

Migrate the test suite to module-owned verification axes.  Each numerical
module owns three parameterized claim registries:

- `test_correctness`: compare outputs against analytical, exact, or residual
  oracles.
- `test_convergence`: verify asymptotic order or residual-rate behavior.
- `test_performance`: verify calibrated cost-to-solution or cost-to-accuracy
  against Tensor-grounded rooflines.

All claims use a single calibrated interface: `description` plus
`check(calibration)`.  Claims without meaningful calibration receive a trivial
module calibration value; no compatibility layer is preserved for the old
`Claim.check()` shape.

CI eligibility is governed by a unified expected walltime policy, not by
bespoke offline markers or environment flags.  Each claim declares, or is
assigned by its module registry, an expected walltime.  The default target is
one second per claim.  Claims expected to exceed the target are skipped in
normal CI and local default runs; they remain available for explicit targeted
stress runs by selecting a higher walltime budget.

Planned PR sequence:

1. **Move Tensor performance into the Tensor module tests.**  Merge the
   Tensor/backend roofline claims from `tests/test_performance.py` into
   `tests/test_tensor.py` under `test_performance`; keep Tensor arithmetic
   and backend behavior under `test_correctness`.  Delete
   `tests/test_performance.py`.
2. **Remove standalone selector and boundary conformance tests.**  Delete
   `tests/test_autotuning.py`; policy behavior is covered implicitly through
   problem regimes in the owning module's correctness, convergence, or
   performance claims.  Delete `tests/test_boundary_conditions.py`; boundary
   behavior should reappear only through outcome-level module claims.
3. **Clean up shared test infrastructure.**  Delete or relocate
   `tests/calibration.py`; its current contents are solver/discrete-operator
   convergence-sizing utilities, not shared harness infrastructure.  Keep
   only genuinely session-wide fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`, such as
   Tensor/device calibration.  Keep only the unified claim interface, shared
   constants, and genuinely shared helpers in `tests/claims.py`.
4. **Standardize claim walltime budgeting.**  Add shared harness support for a
   per-claim expected walltime, defaulting to one second.  Remove explicit
   offline markers and environment-variable gates from migrated tests.  Provide
   a single way to raise the walltime budget for targeted stress runs.
5. **Delete visual regression tests.**  Remove `tests/visual/` and its
   baselines rather than carrying a pytest-mpl exception to the module-owned
   claim harness.
6. **Update structure enforcement.**  Keep `tests/test_structure.py` as
   repository-governance coverage, but update its enforcement claims for the
   unified calibrated claim signature and the module-owned axis convention.

Policy selectors are not a fourth verification axis.  They are covered by
problem regimes that force distinct choices; claims remain named by axis and
mathematical regime, not by selected implementation class or branch.

### Per-epoch verification standard

Every epoch must satisfy this checklist before it is considered verified:

- Derivation document with SymPy checks for any new numerical scheme (Lanes B and C)
- At least one externally-grounded convergence test against an analytical solution
  or observational data (not an engine-generated golden file); where an analytical
  solution exists, the relevant `NumericFunction.symbolic` is declared so the
  check runs automatically
- Lane A/B/C classification stated in the PR description
