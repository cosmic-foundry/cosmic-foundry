class DiffusiveFlux(NumericalFlux[sympy.Expr]):
    """Numerical flux for the diffusive flux F(φ) = -∇φ.

    DiffusiveFlux approximates the face-averaged normal flux -∂φ/∂xₐ·|Aₐ|
    at the interface between two adjacent cells along axis a, where |Aₐ| is
    the face area perpendicular to axis a.

    One class, many instances: DiffusiveFlux(order, continuous_operator) for
    any valid order.  DiffusiveFlux(2, ...) and DiffusiveFlux(4, ...) are
    parameterized instances, not subclasses.  Both satisfy the same Lane C
    contract at their respective orders (see tests/test_convergence_order.py).

    Validity:
        min_order  = 2   — smallest supported order
        order_step = 2   — valid orders are min_order, min_order+step, ...
                           (antisymmetric stencil design constrains order
                           to even integers: odd error terms vanish by
                           antisymmetry; only even orders are achievable)

    Stencil derivation (Lane C):

    At order p = 2n, the stencil uses 2n cells (n on each side of the face).
    Coefficients c_0, ..., c_{n-1} are derived symbolically at construction
    by solving the antisymmetric cell-average moment system:

        gradient ≈ (1/h) Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k · (φ̄_{i+k} − φ̄_{i−1−k})

    where c_k is the coefficient for face offsets ±(2k+1)/2.  The unique
    solution kills all odd Taylor error terms through order h^{p-1}, giving
    leading error O(h^p).

    Explicit results: p=2 → (1,); p=4 → (5/4, -1/12).  These match the
    hardcoded stencils traditionally written as (1,-1)/h and
    (1,-15,15,-1)/(12h) respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    order:
        Integer satisfying order >= min_order and
        (order - min_order) % order_step == 0.  Stencil coefficients are
        derived via SymPy at construction time (~10–40 ms); __call__ uses
        only arithmetic.
    manifold:
        The manifold on which the operator acts; used to construct the
        DiffusionOperator (-∇: Ω⁰ → Ω¹) that this instance approximates.

    __call__ signature:
        (U: MeshFunction) -> MeshFunction

        U        — cell averages (MeshFunction callable with cell index)
        returns  — face-flux MeshFunction callable as result((axis, idx_low))
                   where idx_low is the low-side cell index of the face;
                   the high cell is idx_low with idx_low[axis] + 1.
                   Caller must ensure cells idx_low[axis] − (n−1) through
                   idx_low[axis] + n exist (n = order // 2).
