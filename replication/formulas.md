# Formula Register

A flat cross-reference of every physics formula the engine implements.
One entry per discrete formula. A *formula* here means a specific
equation (a stencil, a flux expression, a rate, an EOS fit) whose
implementation could silently encode a wrong answer — wrong sign,
missing term, wrong coefficient, wrong variant chosen from several
in the literature.

This register complements the `Map:` block on each implementing class or
function. The `Map:` block describes what a map computes and its
approximation parameters; this register maps individual formulas to
their authoritative sources and tests, at finer granularity.

## How to add an entry

Add a row when a PR introduces a formula that:

- has at least one published variant the implementation might
  silently choose differently (Riemann solver wave-speed estimate,
  flux limiter, gauge parameter), or
- contains non-obvious coefficients that must match a specific
  paper (PPM steepener, polynomial EOS fit, nuclear rate network), or
- has a sign or index convention that differs across sources.

Standard textbook operators with no free parameters (a centered
second-order Laplacian, a forward Euler step) qualify only if
something about the implementation is non-obvious — a missing
division by h², an unusual indexing convention, etc.

**Citation convention.** The **Source** field must use a DOI link
(`https://doi.org/<DOI>`) for journal papers and conference
proceedings. For books, use the DOI if one exists (most SIAM and
Springer titles have them); otherwise use the ISBN. Bare author-year
strings without a stable identifier are not acceptable — they rot
within a few years as PDFs move. If you cannot locate a DOI before
opening the PR, use an ADS permalink
(`https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/<bibcode>`) as a fallback for
astrophysics papers; ADS bibcodes are stable indefinitely.

Reference the introducing PR number in the **PR** column.
Update the **Test** column if the validating test moves.

## Entries

### F-001 — 3-D second-order 7-point Laplacian stencil

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Module** | `cosmic_foundry/kernels/__init__.py` — `seven_point_laplacian` example Op; `benchmarks/pointwise_roofline.py` |
| **Formula** | `(φᵢ₋₁,ⱼ,ₖ + φᵢ₊₁,ⱼ,ₖ + φᵢ,ⱼ₋₁,ₖ + φᵢ,ⱼ₊₁,ₖ + φᵢ,ⱼ,ₖ₋₁ + φᵢ,ⱼ,ₖ₊₁ − 6φᵢ,ⱼ,ₖ) / h²` |
| **Source** | Standard second-order finite difference; formula appears in virtually every numerical methods textbook and requires no single authoritative citation. |
| **External grounding** | Analytical: ∇²(x²+y²+z²) = 6 exactly. Test sets φ = x²+y²+z² and asserts the stencil returns 6.0 to float64 tolerance. No paper needed — the expected value is derived by hand in two lines. |
| **Non-obvious detail** | The kernel as implemented returns the **un-divided** stencil sum (numerator only). The caller supplies the grid spacing h and divides. In the Epoch 1 test h = 1 so the raw sum equals the Laplacian; downstream callers must not forget the 1/h² factor. |
| **Test** | `tests/test_kernels.py::test_dispatch_executes_laplacian_over_region` |
| **PR** | #53 |
